## Bubble Sort
The least efficient of sorting algorithms.

__You will write your solution in `lib/bubble.js`__

## Approaching the problem

Watch the video and reason about how Bubble Sort sorts an array of numbers.

__THEN:__

* Write pseudo code to help you understand and organize the problem
* Use the included tests to help you approach the problem in small steps.

__RUNNING TESTS:__
```sh
mocha
```
You should work through tests one at a time. When you have passed the first test,
delete the `x` from the next `xit` statement in `test/bubble.test.js`.

Rinse and repeat until all tests are passing.

__Good developer habits:__

When you get your first test passing, `git status`, `git add` and `git commit` before
moving on to the next test. Do this for each passing test.
